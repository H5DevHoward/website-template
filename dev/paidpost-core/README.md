# paidpost-core (ignore below pending review)

### Clone the paidpost-core Repository

```bash
# Clone this repo to <your componentname>
$ git clone https://github.com/nytpi/paidpost-core.git <your componentname>
$ cd <your componentname>
# Make this repo your own
$ rm -rf .git
$ git init
$ git remote add origin <your repo>
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git push origin master
# Install NPM dependencies
npm install
npm run guide
```

If all is well it's time to start building...

So start by renaming samplecomponent and other related files based on your component's name. You will have to close the preview task and `npm run guide` once you change filenames.
